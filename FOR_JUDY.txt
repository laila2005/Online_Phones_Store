JUDY - FIX FOR INFINITE LOADING ISSUE
===============================================

Your MySQL is running but the website keeps loading forever.
This is almost always because the DATABASE DOESN'T EXIST.

STEP 1: RUN DIAGNOSTIC
-----------------------
Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost/Online_Phones_Store/diagnose.php

This will tell you EXACTLY what's wrong.


MOST LIKELY FIX: IMPORT THE DATABASE
-------------------------------------

You probably haven't imported the database yet!

1. Open phpMyAdmin:
   http://localhost/phpmyadmin

2. Click "Import" tab at the top

3. Click "Choose File"

4. Select: database/fresh_setup.sql
   (from your Online_Phones_Store folder)

5. Click "Go" at the bottom

6. Wait for success message

7. Try the website again:
   http://localhost/Online_Phones_Store/


IF PHPMYADMIN WON'T LOAD
-------------------------

If phpMyAdmin also keeps loading forever:

1. Stop MySQL in XAMPP
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Start MySQL again
4. Try phpMyAdmin again


VERIFY YOUR SETUP
-----------------

After importing database, check:

1. phpMyAdmin shows "ecommerce_db" in left sidebar
2. Click on it - should show 9 tables
3. Click on "products" table - should show 24 rows


TEST THE WEBSITE
----------------

After importing database:

Main site: http://localhost/Online_Phones_Store/
Admin: http://localhost/Online_Phones_Store/admin/login.php
Test: http://localhost/Online_Phones_Store/diagnose.php


WHAT'S HAPPENING
----------------

When you try to load the website:
- PHP tries to connect to database "ecommerce_db"
- Database doesn't exist
- Connection keeps trying and trying
- Page never loads

Solution: Import the database!


IF STILL NOT WORKING
--------------------

1. Run diagnose.php and share the results
2. Check if MySQL is actually running (green in XAMPP)
3. Make sure project is in: C:\xampp\htdocs\Online_Phones_Store
4. Restart computer and try again


QUICK CHECKLIST
---------------

□ MySQL is running (green in XAMPP)
□ Imported database/fresh_setup.sql via phpMyAdmin
□ Database "ecommerce_db" appears in phpMyAdmin
□ Project is in C:\xampp\htdocs\Online_Phones_Store
□ Using correct URL: http://localhost/Online_Phones_Store/

If all checked, website should work!
